# TryHackMe-Progress
My daily TryHackMe room progress, notes and findings. 

**^1st *ROOM*** -Offensing security Intro- 
**STATUS**: COMPLETED

**COMMANDS / CONCEPTS LEARNED**
- Offensive Security (ethical hacking for the analyzation of weak points and resolution) [RED TEAM]
- What is VM (Virtual Machine)
- /dirb (for research hidden pages (URL) in the web-site whit brute-force)


**^2nd *ROOM*** -Defensive Security Intro-
**STATUS**: COMPLETED

**COMMANDS / CONCEPTS LEARNED**
- Defensive Security (Preventing and Detecting intrusion, when they occur and responding properly) [BLUE TEAM]
- **SOC** (Security Operation Center)
  Team of cybersecurity professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect harmful cybersecurity events. *Vulnerabilities*, *Policy Violations*, *Unauthorized Activity*, *Network Intrusion* are the main point where a SOC Analyst give more attention.
- **Threat Intelligence**
  Gathers information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries. Every Target (Company) have different Threat (Banks, Telecomunications, Archives, etc.). Intelligence needs data. Data has to be collected, processed, and analyzed. Data is            collected  from local sources such as network logs and public sources such as forums. Data processing arranges it into a format suitable for analysis. The analysis phase seeks to find more information about the attackers and their motives; moreover, it aims to create   a list of recommendations and actionable steps.
- **DFIR** (Digital Forensics and Incident Response)
  Forensics is the application of science to investigate crimes and establish facts. The focus of digital forensics shifts to analyzing evidence of an attack and its perpetrators and other areas such as intellectual property theft, cyber espionage, and possession of      unauthorized content. Consequently, digital forensics will focus on different areas, such as:

+ **File System**: Analyzing a digital forensics image (low-level copy) of a systemâ€™s storage reveals much information, such as installed programs, created files, partially overwritten files, and deleted files.
+ **System memory**: If the attacker runs their malicious program in memory without saving it to the disk, taking a forensic image (low-level copy) of the system memory is the best way to analyze its contents and learn about the attack.
+ **System logs**: Each client and server computer maintains different log files about what is happening. Log files provide plenty of information about what happened on a system. Even if the attacker tries to clear their traces, some traces will remain.
+ **Network logs**: Logs of the network packets that have traversed a network would help answer more questions about whether an attack is occurring and what it entails.
  
*Notes: [Low-level copy] is the copy of the hidden files in the sistem whitout damage the original, useful when a machine or system is damaged. While the [High-level copy] is the copy of the visible superficials files in the sistem.
